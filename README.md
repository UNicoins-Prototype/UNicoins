# UNicoins
This is the repository for the UNicoins technical prototype. 

## What are UNicoins?
UNicoins are digital tokens  representing UN personnels' time spent on cross-UN collaboration. The tokens are a nonmonetary
unit of value that can be exchanged among project managers and/or collaborators in recognition of collaboration hours contributed to cross-UN work.
UNicoins are an ERC-20 digital token built on Ethereum. 

## How it works 
Alice, a UN personnel, posts a task in the cross-UN marketplace which she needs some help on. 
Bob, a collaborator in the cross-UN marketplace, takes up the task. Bob receives UNicoins for time spent on the task. Each UNicoin represents an hour of work completed. Bob can then donate his UNicoins to other cross-collaboration initiatives where he requires help from other UN personnel.

## Technologies used
- Solidity is used to write the initial smart contract for the ERC-20 token. Tokens can be accessed on the Rinkeby test network via a Metamask (or other) wallet. 
- Aragon is the platform on which the UNicoins Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is created. It encompasses all holders of the UNicoins token for community governance purposes. 
- Gnosis safe is a multi-signature wallet from which votes can be cast to transfer tokens. Administrators can use Gnosis safe to approve transactions of UNicoins to individual contributors. Gnosis forms the basis of prototype distribution of UNicoins
